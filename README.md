# flair-client
flair-client is an asynchronous client to the [@flair-systems](https://github.com/flair-systems) API.
It was written to be used with home-assistant but can have other uses.

## Usage
TBD

## TODO
* Error handling
* Ability to control more entity types (structures, rooms, etc.)
* Add a CLI (Maybe for another project)

## Credits
Much of the code was inspired from the original
[synchronous](https://github.com/flair-systems/) wrapper.
